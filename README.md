# Video Chat App with WebRTC, React.js, Node.js, Socket.IO, and React Player

## Introduction
Welcome to the Video Chat App project! This is a simple video chatting application that leverages WebRTC technology to enable real-time video communication between users. The app is built using modern web technologies like React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and React Player to display video streams.

With this app, users can easily initiate video calls, join existing calls, and have seamless video conversations with each other through their web browsers. The project aims to provide a foundation for building more sophisticated video chat applications and serves as a learning resource for understanding the concepts of WebRTC and real-time communication.
